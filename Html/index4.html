        <p>Carry your exercise gear to and from your training session with ease and choose from a variety of styles and colours available in this bags clearance range. If you’re after a larger style, you’ll love a duffel bag which can easily carry your gym or swimming-pool gear. A waist bag is ideal if you’d like to carry a few small items when you go for your daily jog, while a drawstring bag is perfect when you want to quickly grab a few items and be on your way. If you’re after a versatile style, look for a shoulder bag that can double up as your casual afternoon bag, or a backpack which will leave your arms free and could also be used to carry your work gear.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Optimal designs in comfortable bags sale styles</h5><br>
        <p>The items in our bags outlet range have been designed using the latest technologies to ensure you have maximum comfort when you’re out and about. This starts with the use of padding in the shoulder straps, which ensures your bag can absorb pressure and take the weight off your back, while a set of adjustable straps will enable you to achieve the perfect fit for optimal relief. In addition to protecting your back, bags that have been treated with a TPE coating have superior durability and can better protect your gear against weather conditions.


        </p><br>
        <h4>It’s all in the details</h4><br>
        <p>Every style in this bags sales range comes packed with special details that make it unique and deliver useful characteristics. Pockets are a particularly valuable addition, whether on the inside – enabling you to divide your belongings into neat compartments – or on the outside where they give you the ability to store a few essentials within easy reach. Some backpacks have an additional flap at the top to ensure extra protection from the rain, while others include a mesh pocket which offers breathable storage for your gear after training.
